    "# Module 4: Model Deployment and API Consumption (Optional Module)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the fourth optional module, the following tasks were performed:\n",
    "#### 1. Flask Setup:\n",
    "- Install Flask and set up the project envrionment\n",
    "- Create the necessary folder structre for the Flask application\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask can be installed simply via the command `pip install Flask`. The directory structure for the Flask application is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Directory Structure](../assets/dir_struct.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- ```\n",
    "churn-prediction\n",
    "├── ml_models/ \n",
    "│   ├── model.pkl\n",
    "├── static/\n",
    "│   ├── css/\n",
    "│   |   └── styles.css\n",
    "│   └── images/\n",
    "├── templates/\n",
    "|   └── index.html\n",
    "├── app.py\n",
    "├── requirements.txt   \n",
    "``` -->\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirements can simply be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or a virtual environment can be created and the requirements can be installed via:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m venv venv\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flask application can be run simply by executing `python3 app.py` or `flask run` if the `FLASK_APP` environment variable is set to `app.py` which can be done via `export FLASK_APP=app.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Model Integration\n",
    "- Load the saved model inot the Flask application\n",
    "- Implement endpoints for the API (e.g., /predict)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model pickle files have been loaded using ```joblib``` from the ```ml_models``` directory. The model is then used to make predictions on the input data. \n",
    "The code snippet in the `app.py` file is as shown:\n",
    "![Load Models](../assets/load_models.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. API Development\n",
    "- Develop API endpoints for the following functionalities:\n",
    "    - Prediction: Endpoint to receive input data and return prediction\n",
    "    - Health Check: Endpoint to check the status of the API\n",
    "\n",
    "The API endpoints have been implemented as follows:\n",
    "- `/api/predict`: This endpoint accepts a POST request with the input data and returns the prediction. ```@app.route('/api/predict', methods=['POST'])```\n",
    "- `/api/health`: This endpoint returns the status of the API. ```@app.route('/api/health', methods=['GET'])```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `app.py` file, the code snippet for the API endpoints is as shown:\n",
    "\n",
    "![API Endpoints](../assets/api_dev.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Testing and Validation\n",
    "- Test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or Curl\n",
    "- Validate the predictions returned by the API\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I use a Linux kernel, I decided to use `Curl` to test the API endpoints instead of Postman, since it was more convenient and didn't require any additional installations. The API endpoints can be tested and validated by the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the Flask application using `python3 app.py` or `python app.py` or `flask run`. This starts the Flask server locally on `localhost:5000`.\n",
    "2. Open a new terminal window and run the following commands:\n",
    "    - For the `/api/health` endpoint: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ``` curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/health ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    The following response should be received which indicates that the API is up and running:\n",
    "    ![Health Check](../assets/health_check.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For the `/api/predict` endpoint: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ``` curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/predict -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{ \"gender\": \"Female\", \"SeniorCitizen\": \"Yes\", \"Partner\": \"No\", \"Dependents\": \"No\", \"tenure\": 12, \"PhoneService\": \"Yes\", \"MultipleLines\": \"No\", \"InternetService\": \"DSL\", \"OnlineSecurity\": \"No\", \"OnlineBackup\": \"Yes\", \"DeviceProtection\": \"No\", \"TechSupport\": \"No\", \"StreamingTV\": \"No\", \"StreamingMovies\": \"No\", \"PaperlessBilling\": \"Yes\", \"MonthlyCharges\": 29.85, \"TotalCharges\": 298.5, \"Contract\": \"Month-to-month\", \"PaymentMethod\": \"Electronic check\"}' ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    The following response, which tells the prediction values returned by the models, should be received which indicates that the API is up and running:\n",
    "    ![Prediction Check](../assets/prediction_check.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Documentation\n",
    "- Document the API endpoints with details on how to use them\n",
    "- Provide example requests and responses\n"
